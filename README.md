# Community-Thistle-Invertebrates

This repository contains the raw data collected during a research project investigating the effect of patch quality and connectivity on invertebrate communities, using creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense) as a case study. 

Data is structured so that it must be loaded in using the R studio "Import Dataset" button in the top right window, so that it loads in as a .xlsx in order for the code to run smoothly. 

All datat was collected by me, H. O. Frend, as part of an MRes project for Swansea University during the summer of 2023. Please contact me directly if you would like to use my data, or wish to chat bugs :) 

(If this is one of the lovely people marking my work, thankyou for taking the time to look here, I hope you enjoyed my project, and please let me know if this violates any data protection or publishing rights for the University and I will sort it out ASAP!)

ENJOY :D
